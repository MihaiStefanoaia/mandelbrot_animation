# Mandelbrot Set animation Renderer

For now it renders a single frame at a hard coded center coordinate and range, with a default 8 bit red coloring. This will be changed soon, allowing the user to send parameters via the command line. 

Outputs to a bmp image.

The program is platform agnostic, simply compile with your C compiler of choice. Tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux with gcc.
